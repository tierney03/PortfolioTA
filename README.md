My First Online Portfolio

Using HTML and CSS I have started the framework for my online portfolio. This portfolio will be used to display the work I create as I make my way through the course.

The page contains an About, Work and Contact Me section.

I aimed to keep it simple and clean so i could focus on learning to code it from scratch.
